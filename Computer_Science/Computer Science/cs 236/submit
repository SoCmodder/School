# Function    : CS236 programming assignment submission
#
# User Guide  : You must organize your programming assignments as follows:
#                 - create a directory under your account for your programming assignments
#                 - create sub-directories p1, p2, ..., each for one assignment
#                 - place this Shell script at the same level as p1, p2, ..., not in p1
#                 - before submission, clean files not needed in the final submission 
#                   in the working directory for the assignment 
#                 - move one level up and type submit for submission, without specifying p1 or p2
#                    **** Warning: Make sure your program is finshed properly         *****
#                    **** You cannot submit the assignment twice with a later version *****
#                 - all *.cpp, *.h, *.txt and Makefile in the appropriate assignment from your 
#                   working directory will be submitted 
#                 -
