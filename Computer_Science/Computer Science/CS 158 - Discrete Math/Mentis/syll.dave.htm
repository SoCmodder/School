<B>Grading Strategy:</B> I expect a quality effort and will grade accordingly. I will drop two homework and two quiz grades.<BR><BR> 

<B>Grading Scale:</B><BR>
90 - 100 %     ==  A<BR>
80 - 89.99 %     ==  B<BR>
70 - 79.99 %     ==  C<BR>
60 - 69.99 %     ==  D<BR>
Below 60 %     ==  F<BR><BR>

<B>Absences:</B> All students are responsible for any classes they miss. In order for a student who misses an exam to receive a make-up exam, the student must submit it writing a valid reason for missing the exam, and proof of that reason, such as a doctor's excuse. There are no homework/quiz makeups. Two or more abscences in any two week period will be grounds for being dropped from the course unless you can show cause as to why I shouldn't.<BR><BR>

<B>Low Average:</B> Students whose class average falls below 70% will be required to show cause to the instructor as to why they should NOT be dropped from the course.<BR><BR>

<B>Final Exam:</B> It will be a comprehensive final exam, given at the time indicated in the Revised Schedule of Classes, Fall 2002.<BR><BR>

<B>Test Dates:</B> Roughly every 4 weeks. See also online schedule of topics.<BR><BR>

<B>Homework:</B> Daily homework will be turned in at (start of !) class time. I do not accept homework submitted by e-mail. I do not accept late homework.<BR><BR>

<B>Quizes:</B> Quizes will be given very frequently. Please don't ask me on an ad hoc basis whether there is / isn't a quiz "today". If there is compelling reason you can't be there, so be it. If there isn't, please come !<BR><BR>

<B>Attendance:</B> I may take roll from time to time, by voice or sign up sheet, for the purposes of determining who's there & getting to know you, and to
 encourage attendance. If you miss any, I still want to know / know why.<BR><BR>

<B>Online Schedule:</B> I will keep a schedule of events online, at http://www.cs.umr.edu/~davem/CSc158, so
you will know what is planned for each day. I will notify you from time to time when there are changes.<BR><BR>

<B>Help:</B> It is very important to me that everyone in this class is successful in learning the material. If I say something in lecture or lab that raises questions, please ask about it !! It is very likely others have questions as well. Please take advantage of my office hours, as well -- as indicated above, you can
come by any time !!<BR><BR>

<B>Additional Contact:</B> I'll do my best to address any questions/concerns you have about this class -- please don't hesitate to ask. If there are questions/concerns about the course I'm unable to resolve to your satisfaction, please contact my departmental chair, Dr. Daniel St. Clair. His office is in 325C CSc Building. His email is stclair@umr.edu<BR><BR>



<B>Study Hints:</B><BR>
Read textbook 2 days in advance of class.<BR>
Attend Lecture and do an initial attempt at Homework before the lecture.<BR>
Review Lecture.<BR>
Reread Text and review Homework and Quizes.<BR>
Office hours.<BR><BR>

<B>Integrity/Ethics:</B> All work handed in should be your own. Any instance of
cheating will result in a zero on that assignment. Further action may be taken as well. Also note that a person who allows others to copy their work is also guilty of cheating. If you obtain work from someone else without their knowledge/permission you are guilty of cheating and plagiarism. In this case you will be dropped from the class and a letter will be sent to your advisor.<BR><BR>

<B>Syllabus Changes:</B> I reserve the right to revise this syllabus as needed. If this occurs, you will be informed accordingly.<BR><BR>
