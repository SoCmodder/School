The Rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All work must be shown for full credit on any given problem.



\item The  value of each problem is given. There are a total of
12 problems. The test is 6 pages, counting the cover page.

\item This is a closed note, closed book, open mind exam. You may use your
calculator.

\item If you are wearing a hat with a brim, turn the brim to the back
of your head. 

\item Stay calm. Stay cool. Start with a problem you are certain you can do.

\item Keep working on problems that you can do, and save those that require 
more thought until the end.

\item Price does not include dealer prep or delivery.

\item The Constitution -- void where prohibited by law.

\item Please consult your physician before beginning this or any other exam.

\item Might be over 18 to enter.

\item Shirt and shoes optional.

\begin{enumerate}

\item (4 points) Let U = \{a, b, c, d\}, A = \{a, b, c\}, B = \{b, c, d\}

\vspace{0.3in}

Find $f_{A \cap B} $  (x)

\vspace{1.0in}

\item (4 points) Let A = \{a, b, c, d\}

\vspace{0.3in}

(a) What is $ \mid $ A $ \mid $ ?

\vspace{0.3in}

(b) Given that P(A) is the power set of A, what is $ \mid $ P(A) $ \mid $ ?

\vspace{1.0in}

\item (6 points) There are 30 people who enter various part(s) of a compitition
that has swimming, cycling, and running -- you can enter 1, 2, or all 3 parts.
18 people swim. 8 people cycle. 10 people run. 2 people swim and cycle. 2 people
swim and run. 3 people cycle and run.

\vspace{0.3in}

How many people do all 3 (swim, cycle, and run) ?

\vspace{2.5in}

\newpage
\item (4 points) Let S = \{0,1\}. Find a regular expression that generates exactly the following regular set.
 
\vspace{.3in}

\{00, 01, 0000, 0001, 000000, 000001, 00000000, 00000001, ...\}

\vspace{.1in}

In other words, the set contains sequences having an even number of
zeroes starting with 2 zeroes, and contains sequences having an odd
number of zeroes followed by a single one, with the first entry
having one zero and a one.

\vspace{1.0in}

\item (6 points) Prove the following :

\vspace{.1in}

If a $ \mid $ b or a $ \mid $ c, then a $ \mid $ bc

\vspace{2.5in}

\item (8 points) Write the equation d = sa + tb for a = 210, b = 22,
and s, t integers by using Euclid's algorithm for GCD and then solving
the equations in reverse order as we did in the textbook and in class.

\vspace{1.5in}

% \end{enumerate}

\newpage
\item (4 points) Given the following matrices A and B, show how to determine
what value goes into the product of the matrices in the 3rd row, 2nd column
by writing the expression as a sum of products from the two given matrices --
I don't want you to use your calculator to get the actual number -- I want you 
to show HOW it is calculated.

\begin{equation*}
  A = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr}
                     1  &  2  &  3  \\
                     4  &  5  &  6  \\
                     7  &  8  &  9  \\
             \end{array} \right]
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  B = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr}
                     0  &  2  &  4  \\
                     6  &  8  & 10  \\
                    12  & 14  & 16  \\
             \end{array} \right]
\end{equation*}

\item (4 points) Give the identity element, if one exists, for each binary
operation in the structure given below.

\vspace{0.2in}

[subsets of a finite set A,    $ \oplus $  ]

\vspace{1.0in}

\item (4 points) Below are 2 different logical expressions. They are
not equivalent, but one of them does imply the other. Tell which one implies
the other.

\vspace{0.2in}

$\forall$ x(H(x) v C(x))

\vspace{0.1in}

$\forall$ xH(x) v $\forall$ xC(x)

\vspace{1.0in}

\item (4 points) Given we want to prove something of the form p $ \Rightarrow $ q , an indirect proof of this uses (circle one)

\vspace{.2in}

\begin{enumerate}
\item the converse
\vspace{0.1in}
\item the inverse
\vspace{0.1in}
\item the contrapositive
\vspace{0.1in}
\item the negation of the conclusion

\vspace{1.0in}

\item (4 points) Given we want to prove something of the form p $ \Rightarrow $ q, where q is something that never exists, we would likely instead use (circle
one)

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{enumerate}
\item direct proof
\vspace{0.1in}
\item indirect proof
\vspace{0.1in}
\item proof by contradiction
