<B>Extra Credit Work:</B> None.<BR><BR>

<B>Absences/Drops/Etc...:</B> All students are responsible for any classes and assignments they miss. I expect the student to contact me regarding these so we can discuss why they were missed, and what action to take. In order for a student who misses to receive a make-up, the student must submit it writing a valid reason for missing, and proof of that reason, such as a doctor's excuse. Generally, a miss due to illness that is confirmed by student affairs, or a death in the family is good reason -- others will be evaluated as they arise. My alarm clock failed, or I need to leave early for a vacation, or catch a ride, are examples of what WON'T be accepted. Please read below for more specific details based
on various types of assignments.<BR><BR>

I'll take attendance by various methods -- voice, signup sheet, quiz, etc.<BR><BR>

I reserve the right to give a quiz at any time, announced or not -- DON'T
SKIP CLASS.<BR><BR>

Homework and Programs are due at the START of class time.<BR><BR>

Homework / Quizes -- You are allowed to drop the lowest score for 2 of
these (2 total, NOT 2 of each !). If you have valid reason to miss more
than 2, we'll discuss what action to take. Generally, if all your
misses / absences are valid and these aren't excessive, you'll receive
a makeup. If they are excessive, you may need to drop the course. 
You are responsible for knowing all homework / quiz material even if 
it is excused from being turned in.<BR><BR>

Exams that are missed for valid reason must be made up.<BR><BR>

All programs need to be turned in -- you are allowed to turn in
2 of them up to 3 days late each.<BR><BR>


3 unexcused absences from class and/or 3 unexcused missing assignments not being turned in will be grounds for me to drop you from the course, unless you can show cause as to why I shouldn't<BR><BR>

Students whose class average falls below 70% will be required to show cause to
the instructor as to why they should NOT be dropped from the class.<BR><BR>



<B>Final Exam:</B> There will be a comprehensive final exam, given at the time indicated in the Revised Schedule of Classes, Fall 2002.<BR><BR>


<B>Help:</B> It is very important to me that everyone in this class is successful in learning programming. If I say something in lecture or lab that raises questions, please ask about it !! It is very likely I have confused many people. Please take advantage of my office hours, as well -- as indicated above, you can
come by any time !!<BR><BR>

<B>Additional Contact:</B> I'll do my best to address any questions/concerns you have about this class -- please don't hesitate to ask. If there are questions/concerns about the course I'm unable to resolve to your satisfaction, please contact my departmental chair, Dr. Daniel St. Clair. His office is in 325C CSc Building. His email is stclair@umr.edu<BR><BR>


<B>Study Hints:</B><BR>
Read textbook in advance of class.<BR>
Attend Lecture/Lab and do Homework/Programs.<BR>
Review Lecture and Homework/Programs.<BR>
Reread Text.<BR>
Work self-test exercises in textbook.<BR>
Office hours.<BR><BR>

<B>Integrity/Ethics:</B> All work handed in should be your own -- In order to receive credit for work submitted, you must understand it. For purposes of detecting cheating, and also to assist grading I/my grader may have you explain any work submitted in detail. Any instance of
cheating (such as working together on a program and then changing small details) will result in a zero on that assignment, or the loss of a letter grade, whichever is the larger penalty. Further action may be taken as well. Also note that a person who allows others to copy their work is also guilty of cheating. If you obtain work from someone else without their knowledge/permission you are guilty of cheating and plagiarism. In this case you will be dropped from the class and a letter will be sent to your advisor.<BR><BR>

<B>Syllabus Changes:</B> I reserve the right to revise this syllabus as needed. If this occurs, you will be informed accordingly.<BR><BR>
