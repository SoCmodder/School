Exam 1                                  Page x of y

This test is closed books/closed notes.  You will not need a
calculator.  
 
If any answer is illegible it will be considered incorrect.
 
Unless told otherwise, for all program fragments given in the
questions you may assume that all necessary include files have been
included and that there are no errors in the sections of code not 
explicitly given.  

For T/F questions, circle either T or F.
For multiple choice questions, circle the correct letter or number.

          2. variable

          3. argument

          4. symbolic constant




(3) 11. A compiler is a program that

          1. links the object file with other object files (resolves
             cross-references among object files)

          2. allows creation and editing of a program written in a high-level
             language

          3. translates a high-level language program source file into a
             machine language object file.

          4. copies executable files into memory and initiates execution of
             instructions.




(3) 12. A syntax error occurs when a computer program

          1. directs the computer to perform an illegal operation

          2. has been written to follow an incorrect algorithm.

          3. violates one or more grammar rules of the C++ language.

          4. does not input data from an external data file.

         else
            cout << "Bye";


(3) 15. Given the code segment below, what is the output? (Assume this segment
        is embedded in a working program.)

         int iA = 6;
         if(iA == 5)
            cout << "Hello";
         cout << " World";


(3) 16. Write the exact output produced by the following code segment. (Assume
        this segment is embedded in a working program.)

         short siNum = 5;
         cout << "siNum = " << siNum;



(3) 17. Which of the following best describes what happens when the following
        line is included in a working program in an appropriate location

         #include <iostream.h>

         a. Allows the programmer to make use of the input and output streams,
            cin and cout.

         b. Allows the GNU complier to interpret Hungarian Notation.

         c. Allows the program to bypass the pre-processor.

         d. It is necessary for the program to compile.



(3) 18. Which of the following is the proper way to code in C++, if the
        conditional expression is stated in English as "x and y are both equal
        to zero "?

         1.      x && y == 0
   
         2.      x & y = 0

         3.      x == 0 && y == 0

         4.      x = 0 & y = 0



(3) 19. Write the output produced by the following code segment. (Assume this
        segment is embedded in a working program.

           int iMark = 94, iTime = 82;

           cout << iTime << endl;
           if(iTime >= iMark)
           {
              iTime++;
           }
           else
           {
              iTime= iMark-iTime;
           }
           cout << "Time: " << iTime << endl;




(3) 20. Given the code segment below, write the output. (Assume this segment is
        embedded in a working program.)

         int iVal;
         for(iVal = 1; iVal < 15; iVal = iVal + 3)
         {
            cout << iVal << ", ";
         }
         cout << endl << "The end!";

(3) 21. Write a for loop that sums the odd integers from 1 to 115 inclusive.
        This value should be stored in an integer variable named iVal.


(3) 22. Which of the following best describes the difference between a while
        loop and a do-while loop.

         a. There is no difference.

         b. Any do-while loop can be written as a while loop, but not every
            while loop can be written as a do-while loop.

         c. Do-whiles typically require more lines of code.

         d. The LCV (loop control variable) is tested prior to a loop body 
            execution in a while, and after loop body execution in a do-while.


(3) 23. Write the output produced by the following code segment. (Assume this
        segment is embedded in a working program.)

         int iCount = 0;
         while(iCount <= 3)
         {
             iCount++;
             cout << iCount;
         }



(3) 24. Consider the following code segment:

         int j, k;
         for (k = 0; k < 10; k++)
         {
            for (j = 0; j < 5; j++)
            cout << "*";
         }
         cout << endl;

         How many stars are output when this code segment is executed?

           A. 15
           B. 55
           C. 66
           D. 50


    
(10) 25. Write a complete program (don't code your name, section, or a
         description -- I don't need any comments not even for variable
         declarations). 

         The program should prompt the user to enter 2 integers,
         iA and iB.

         If iA >= iB, then it should print out the value of iA.

         If iA < iB, then it should print out the value of iB.

         You don't need to put in a do-while loop to allow the user
         to run this multiple times -- assume it runs just 1 time.
