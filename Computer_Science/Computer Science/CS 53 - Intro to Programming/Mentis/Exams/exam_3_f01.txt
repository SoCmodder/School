This test is closed books/closed notes.  You will not need a
calculator.  
 
If any answer is illegible it will be considered incorrect.
 
Unless told otherwise, for all program fragments given in the
questions you may assume that all necessary include files have been
included and that there are no errors in the sections of code not 
explicitly given.  

For T/F questions, circle either T or F.
For multiple choice questions, circle the correct letter or number.

       integers such that each array value is equal to its index.

(4) 2. Given the code below, what character is stored in the 
       element szFred[7]?
	
          char szFred[] = "program";

(4) 3. Write an additional line of C++ code that will copy the string 
       "foobar" into the character array szWord. Assume the appropriate 
       #include statements are present.

          c. 5
          d. Fails to compile.

(4) 5. What is the output produced by the following code segment. (Assume 
       this segment is embedded in a working program.) 

          int iItem3 = 7;
          int iItem[5] = {0};

(4) 6. Declare a one dimensional array named rgfArr of type float that 
       contains 20 elements.

(4) 7. TRUE       FALSE:  The array declaration "int lengths[49];" 
                          allocates 50 storage locations for integer values 
                          with the indices of the array being 0-49.

(4) 8. Write the output produced by the following code segment.

              int rgiBob[5] = {9, 8, 7, 6, 5};
              int iIndex = 1;
              int iX = rgiBob[iIndex + 2];
              int iY = rgiBob[iIndex] + 2;
              cout << iX << "  " << iY;

(4) 9. Write a for loop that will assign the value 7.5 to all the
       elements of the following array that's declared. 

       float rgfTemp[5];

(4) 10. The Box below represents the array rgiBob. Fill in the box with the 
        values that would be there after the code is executed. (Assume this 
        segment is embedded in a working program.) 

              int iCounter;
              int rgiBob[] = {15, 25, 10, 30, 40};
              for(iCounter = 0; iCounter < 4; iCounter++)
              {
                 rgiBob[iCounter] = rgiBob[iCounter+1];
              }

(4) 11. A single-dimensional array can be used to store a list of values of 
        the same

           a. sentinel value
           b. chain sequence
           c. address pointer
           d. data type


(4) 12. Where in a program can the programmer directly access private 
        members of a class named CBox?

           1. Anywhere
           2. The main function
           3. Any function
           4. Member functions of any class
           5. None of these

(4) 13. Write a structure definition that contains an integer variable named 
        iVal, and a floating point variable named fNum.

(4) 14. Given the code below, write a line of C++ code that assigns the 
        value 50 to the variable m_siStars of the object MyFlag. 

                struct SFlag {
                   short m_siStars;
                   short m_siStripes;
                };
                int main()
                {
                   SFlag MyFlag;

                   return 0;
                }

(4) 15. Given the class definition below, write a constructor that will 
        assign the value 5 to the integer, and 'z' to the character. 

                class Stuff
                {
                	public:
                   		Stuff();

                   		char m_cLabel;
                   		int m_iSize;
                };

(4) 16. Given the class definition below, write the GetSize function that 
        will return the value stored in the variable m_iSize to the caller.

                class CBox
                {
                public:
                   CBox();
                   int GetSize();
                private:
                   int m_iSize;
                };

(4) 17. Given the class definition below, write the SetSize function that 
        will take one integer argument, and assign the value stored in the 
        argument to m_iSize. 

                class CBox
                {
                public:

                   void SetSize(int);

                   int m_iSize;
                };

(6) 18. Suppose your program contains the following class definition (along 
        with definitions of the member functions):

           class YourClass
	   {
           public:
              YourClass(int new_info, char more_new_info);
              YourClass();
              void do_stuff();

           private:
              int information;
              char more_information;
	   };



	   Circle the following that are legal:

           A. YourClass an_object(42, 'A');
           B. YourClass another_object;
           C. YourClass yet_another_object();
           D. an_object = YourClass(99,'B');
           E. an_object = YourClass();
           F. an_object = YourClass;


(4) 19. Suppose bla is an object, dobedo is a member function of the object 
        bla, and dobedo takes on argument of type int. How do you write a 
        call to the member function dobedo of the object bla using the 
        argument 7?
