Exam 2                                  Page 1 of x

This test is closed books/closed notes.  You will not need a
calculator.  
 
If any answer is illegible it will be considered incorrect.
 
Unless told otherwise, for all program fragments given in the
questions you may assume that all necessary include files have been
included and that there are no errors in the sections of code not 
explicitly given.  


(3) 1. What is the purpose of using overloaded functions ?

(2) 2. T  /  F
       Pass-by-value uses a pointer to the variable in the calling function,
       and pass-by-reference makes a copy of the variable in the calling 
       function.

(3) 3. What does the type of a function refer to ?

(3) 4. How can I get 2 numbers back from a function ?


(3) 5. A test of an output file being opened correctly fails. Give
       a possible reason why.
       

(2) 6. Can a function definition appear inside the body of another function
       definition ?
                  
(2) 7. Can a function call appear inside the body of another (different)
       function definition ?

(8) 8. Write a function that takes 2 integer arguments and finds the sum,
       the difference of the first minus the second, and the product
       of the 2 numbers and gets all that information back to the calling
       function (it doesn't print anything out, and the 2 numbers used
       for adding, subtracting, and multiplying are not changed).

(8) 9. Write a function definition for a function that takes one argument 
       of type double. The function returns the character value 'P' if its
       argument is positive, and returns 'N' if its argument is zero or
       negative.

(12) 10. Consider the following code : Tell what output it generates. 

         #include <iostream.h>

         float myfunc1(int x, int &y, int &z);
         int myfunc2(int &a, int b);

         int main()
         {
            int a = 4, b = 6, y = 3, x = 1, z;
            float result;
            result = myfunc1(myfunc2(a,b), y, z);
            cout << a << " " << b << " " << x << " " << y << " " 
                 << z << " " << result << endl;
            return 0;
         }

         float myfunc1(int x, int &y, int &z)
         {
            z = x*y;
            return x*y*z;
         }

         int myfunc2(int &a, int b)
         {
            a *= 2;
            b *= 2;
            return a*a/b;
         }



(8) 11. Consider the following code (and assume that it is embedded in a
        complete and correct program and then run) :

        What will be output if the following input is used ?
        (note: there is exactly 1 space between the 'f' and 'g' below
         and the 'a' is the first character on the line).


        abcdef ghi




        char next;
        int count = 0;
        cout << "Enter a line of input:\n";
        cin.get(next);
        while (next != '\n')
        {
           if((count % 3) == 0)
              cout << next;
           count++
           cin.get(next);
        }

(8) 12. Consider the following code (and assume that it is embedded in a
        complete and correct program and then run) :

        cout << "Enter a line of input:\n";
        char next;
        do
        {
           cin.get(next);
           cout << next;
        }
        while( (! isdigit(next)) && (next != '\n') );
        cout << "END OF OUTPUT";





        If the dialogue begins as follows, what will be the next
        line of output ?

        (note: 'isdigit(foo)' returns 'true' if 'foo' is a digit --
        0, 1, 2, ... 9, and false if it is not)

         
        Enter a line of input:
        I'll see you at 10:30 AM.


(12) 13. Write a function definition to take an opened file that's 
         verified already and write out exactly what it reads in 
         except you should delete all blanks found in the input.

         e.g.
         input contains :

         How now brown  cow.

         output contains :

         Hownowbrowncow.
