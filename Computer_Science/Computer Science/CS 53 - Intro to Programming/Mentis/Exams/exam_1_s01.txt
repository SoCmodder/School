This test is closed books/closed notes.  You will not need a
calculator.  
 
If any answer is illegible it will be considered incorrect.
 
Unless told otherwise, for all program fragments given in the
questions you may assume that all necessary include files have been
included and that there are no errors in the sections of code not 
explicitly given.  

For T/F questions, circle either T or F.
For multiple choice questions, circle the correct letter.

              cout << "foo2" << endl;
        else
           if(x < 0)

           else
              cout << "foo4" << endl;

(3) 17. What output is produced by the following code when x = 25 ?

           if(x > 30)
              cout << "foo1" << endl;
        }
        else
           cout << "foo2" << endl;

(2) 18. The design phase of the software development process deals with

        a) Finding out what the user wants.
        b) Telling the user what restrictions exist in terms of what 
           they can have versus what they'd like to have.
        c) Finding an algoritm, or method, to solve the problem.
        d) Finding the correct coding constructs to satisfy the complier.
        e) Finding my car keys.

(2) 19. Hungarian notation is used because
     
        a) It is necessary to satisfy the computer.
        b) It satifies the Hungarian members involved in ISO certification
           of C++.
        c) It makes it easier for a programmer looking at the code to
           determine what type a variable is without having to search
           througout the program.
        d) While not necessary for a program to compile, it will execute
           more efficiently.

(2) 20. 'mkdir foo' does the following :

        a) makes a file called 'foo' in a directory called 'dir'
        b) makes a directory called 'foo' in my current directory.
        c) makes me a ham sandwich.
        d) makes a file called 'foo.dir' in my current directory.

(2) 21. Machine languages are

        a) Portable, not very English like.
        b) Not portable, very English like.
        c) Not portable, not very English like.
        d) Portable, very English like.

(2) 22. Name at least 1 thing C++ has that C does not.

(2) 23. What 1 thing must every C++ program have ?

(2) 24. T/F. Comments that begin with // continue across multiple lines, 
             if need be, until and ending // terminates the comment.

(10) 25. Write a complete program (don't code your name, section, or a
         description -- I don't need any comments except for variable
         declarations). The program should read in the weight of 1 box
         of cereal in grams, and convert that to pounds (lb.) and output
         that result. It should also compute how many boxes of cereal
         there are per pound and output that as well.

         You don't need to put in a do-while loop to allow the user
         to run this multiple times -- assume it runs just 1 value.

         Note : 1 lb. = 453.6 g.

         As an example, if you read in 1 box == 100 g, then

         1 box weighs 0.2204586 lbs.
         It takes 4.536 boxes to make 1 lb.
