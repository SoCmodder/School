Exam 3                                  Page x of y

This test is closed books/closed notes.  You will not need a
calculator.  
 
If any answer is illegible it will be considered incorrect.
 
For any functions you write, if a parameter doesn't ever need to
be altered by the function, be sure it is passed in such a way
that it can't mistakenly be altered by the function.


1. Write a function that takes a 1-dimensional float array 'A' and an  
   integer size 'SIZE'. The function should shift a value to the "next"
   location to the right in the array, and the rightmost value should
   be moved to the far left. As an example...

   Input array  :  1.3   3.7   4.4   2.6   3.0
   Output array :  3.0   1.3   3.7   4.4   2.6

2. Write a function that takes a 1-dimensional integer array 'A' of
   size 'SIZE' and returns an integer value. The value should be the
   first location that is out of place, with correct placement meaning
   the values are from low to high. If 2 adjacent values are the same,
   that is ok. But if from one value to the next you go from high to low,
   the location of the low should be returned. If the entire array is in
   the correct order, return a -1.

   As an example :

   Input array  :  1  2  2  0  4

   Returned value : 3 (the 0 is out of place, and it's location is
                    position 3 since the array starts at index 0.)

3. Write a function that takes a 2-dimensional integer array 'A' of size
   N1 x N2 and determines which row has largest sum, and what that sum
   is. These values should be made available to the calling function.
   As an example :

   Input array :  2  4  6  8
                  3  5  7  9
                  4  6  8 10
                  1  3  5  7

   Info made available to calling function :  (max row is) 2 (note that the
   "first" row is row 0). (sum is) 28 (4 + 6 + 8 + 10).
   
4. Write a function that takes a 2-dimensional integer square array 'A' of size
   N1 x N1. The function should compute the sum of 2 diagonals, and return
   a boolean value. One diagonal is the main one (contains 1, 6, 11, 16 below)
   and the other is the opposite one -- it starts in the upper right corner
   and ends in the lower left (contains 4, 7, 10, 13 below).

   If the main is greater than or equal to the other one, return 'true',
   otherwise return 'false'.

   Input array  :  1  2  3  4
                   5  6  7  8
                   9 10 11 12
                  13 14 15 16

   Returned value : true , (1+6+11+16 == 4+7+10+13)   


5. Write a class and the implementation of the functions that declares 
   a class called CounterType. An object of this type is used to count things, 
   so it records a count that is a non-negative whole number. Include a 
   default constructor that sets the counter to 0, and a constructor
   with one argument that sets the counter to the value specified by its
   argument (Unless it's less than 0, in which case it should set it to 0).
   Include member functions to increase the count by 1 and to decrease
   the count by 1. Be sure that non member function allows the value of
   the counter to become negative. Also include a member function that returns
   the current count value to the calling function.
  
6. The following statement sets aside memory for how many characters ?

   char s[] = "foo";          

7. What is the value of x after the following code executes ?
   
   char s1[] = "foo";
   char s2[] = "bat";
   if(strcmp(s1,s2))
      x = 10;               
   else
      x = 20;


8. What (if anything) is wrong with the following code ?

   char cStringVar[] = "Hello";
   strcat(cStringVar, " and Good-bye.");
   cout << cStringVar;

   Assume that the code is embeded in a complete program and that the
   necessary include directives are there also.

9. Write code using a library function to copy string constant "Hello"
   into the string variable declared below. Be sure to #include the necessary 
   header file to get the declaration of the function you use.

   char cAString[10];
