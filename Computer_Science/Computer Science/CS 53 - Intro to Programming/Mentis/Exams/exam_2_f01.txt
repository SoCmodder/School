This test is closed books/closed notes.  You will not need a
calculator.  
 
If any answer is illegible it will be considered incorrect.
 
Unless told otherwise, for all program fragments given in the
questions you may assume that all necessary include files have been
included and that there are no errors in the sections of code not 
explicitly given.  

For T/F questions, circle either T or F.
For multiple choice questions, circle the correct letter or number.

(4)  1. After the function MyFunction below is executed, what value is
        returned from this function if the argument 4 is passed to the
        function ? (Assume this segment is embedded in a working program.)

     int MyFunction(int iInput)
     {
        int iResult = 1;
        for(int iCtr = 2; iCtr <= iInput; iCtr++)
        {
           iResult = iResult * iCtr;
        }
        return iResult;
     }

(2)  2. Which of the following best describes the difference between  
        pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.

           a. There is no difference.
           b. Void functions must use pass-by-reference.
           c. Pass-by-value and pass-by-reference parameters (arguments) 
              cannot coexist in the same parameter list.
           d. An argument instantiating a pass-by-value parameter cannot
              be changed in the calling function whereas a pass-by-reference
              parameter can be changed.

(3)  3. Write a function prototype that has the following characteristics :
        
           1. The function is named FooBar
           2. The function returns a character
           3. The function takes as an argument a pass-by-value integer
              called iBob.

(2)  4.  TRUE    FALSE    A function is not required to have a return value.

(2)  5.  TRUE    FALSE    The use of a function prototype is required by the
                          compiler.

(2)  6.  TRUE    FALSE    Every C++ executable program must have a main     
                          function.

(2)  7.  TRUE    FALSE    Variables listed in the formal parameter list of a
                          function definition should not be declared within
                          the body of the function statements.

(2)  8. Which of the following is a valid function prototype ?             

           1. float Green(w, x, y, z)
           2. char Blue(int a, double b);
           3. stub Red(int);
           4. Yellow();
           5. White(char 'M');

(2)  9. Which of the following is a valid function invocation (call) ?     

           1. float Green(w, x, y, z)
           2. char Blue(int a, double b);
           3. stub Red(int);
           4. Yellow();
           5. White(char 'M');

(6) 10. What is the output of the following program ?

        #include<iostream.h>

        void figure_me_out(int& x, int y);

        int main()
        {
           int a, b, c;
           a = 10;
           b = 20;
           c = 30;

           figure_me_out(a, b);
           cout << a << " " << b << endl;

           return 0;
        }

        void figure_me_out(int& x, int y)
        {
           cout << x << " " << y << endl;
           x = 1;
           y = 2;
           cout << x << " " << y << endl;
           return;
        }

(6) 11. Write a void function definition for a function called zero_both
        that has two reference parameters, both of which are variables of
        type int, and sets the values of both variables to 0.

(3) 12. Is a correct call to a void function followed by a semicolon a   
        statement in its own right ? Or must we embed the function call
        in an expression ?

(3) 13. Suppose you have two function definitions with the following
        prototypes :

           double score(double time, double distance);
           int score(double points);

        Which function definition would be used in the following function
        call and why would it be the one used ? (x is of type double).

           final_score = score(x);

(6) 14. Declare an input file called ifScores and open it so that it is
        attached to an external file (in UNIX) called ifscores.dat
        (you can hardcode this -- you need not prompt the user for any
        file name).

(3) 15. Assume there exists a declaration of

        ifstream ifBob;

        Write the statement that closes the file ifBob.

(8) 16. Consider the following code (and assume it is embeded in a complete
        and correct program and then run) :

        char next;
        int count = 0;
        cout << "Enter a line of input: << endl;
        cin.get(next);
        while(next != '\n')
        {
           if((count % 2) == 0)    // true if count is even.
              cout << next;
           count++;
           cin.get(next);
        }

        The prompt and the 1 line of data are below (the line of stars
        below the line of numbers is just there to show spacing for this 
        exam since you can't tell how many blanks there are between some
        numbers -- the stars are NOT input !).


        Enter a line of input:
        0 1  2 345 6 7 89  10 11
        ************************  (stars below numbers/blanks are just
                                   to tell you spacing of numbers -- they
                                   are NOT input !!).
