Project 2: The Deadline Scheduling Problem

Introduction
	The goal of this paper is to examine the properties of the Deadline
Schuduling Problem and to compare various algorithms for generating solutions
to the problem.  The Deadline Scheduling Problem is NP-complete, which means
that no efficient method for solving the problem exists.  Therefore, solving
the problem is very costly.  By using a dynamic programming technique with
tables, the time complexity of the problem is greatly reduced at the price of
a much increased memory complexity.  It is also possible to reduce the time
required by generating a solution that is not quite optimal.  Using this
method, known as Greedy Heuristics, both the time complexity and space
complexity are substantially reduced.
