           CLIENT-SERVER COMMUNICATIONS via SOCKETS: GROUP-CHAT PROGRAM  


Due: 12/4/2003 - Class Time
=============================================================================
REQUIRED READING: 
 - An Intro.to UNIX (Wang) Chapter 12 (pp. 398-416) and section 9.6
 - Read about the following C functions:
    socket, bind, listen, accept, gethostbyname, read, write, 
    bcopy(), sockaddr_in, htons(), close()
 - Examine carefully the two sample programs available on the webpage   
 - Examine "server-template" and "client-template" available on the webpage
 - Read "IPC-Handout" available on the webpage
=============================================================================

Create a Server program and a Client program. Any text that a client types
(and sends to the server) should be echoed on the display of all other
clients that are attached to the server.
Server should continuously loop and accept messages from clients
and then echo them. Each client gets a unique name which will be passed to
the server at the time when the connection is established.

  1. Use stream sockets
  2. You must use the INET protocol (TCP/IP)
  3. You must run simultaneously at least 2 clients
  4. At least 2 different machines must be utilized.
  5. Each client should be run under 'script'.
  6. The server may generate logging type output if you wish.
  7. The clients should know who sent each message.
  8. Compile your programs as follows:
         gcc -o server server.c -lpthread -lnsl
         gcc -o client client.c -lpthread -lnsl

==========================================================================


(1) Please Use the 'script' command to capture all necessary 
    information for handin as described in the previous assignments.

(2) After you have generated the 'script' file, remove ^M (cntl-M)s 
    from your script file.

(3) Print your hardcopy by entering
       a2ps myhandin  |  lpr -P yourPrinterPreference

(4) Also store your source files, script file (myhandin#), and the
    executable file, in the directory:  ~cs284/YourLoginName/proj#/
    where # = Assignment number
