Program Assignment #7</h1>

<h2>
Logic Programming with the 8051 in C</h2>

<h3>
Due 3/23/2001 (10 points)</h3>
We would like to construct a controller for a small DC motor. We have three
single pole single throw (SPST) switches called A, B, and C. The motor
is to be on when switch A is on or when switches B and C are different.
We will connect switches A, B, and C to the 8051's Port 1 bits 0, 1, and
2, and the motor drive to Port 1 bit 3. Assume that the motor drive circuit
is active high (a '1' on P1.3 turns the motor on). We are not interested
in the specific details of the motor drive circuit here. It only provides
current buffering and isolation between the microcontroller and the inductive
load of the motor.
<ol>
<li>
Draw a schematic diagram for your controller similar to those in the text.</li>

<li>
Write a logic expression for the controller: Motor_on = f(A,B,C).</li>

<li>
Write a complete C program for the 8051 which will implement your logic
expression.</li>

<li>
Use uVision to enter and compile your program. Produce an assembly language
listing file.</li>

<li>
Use dScope to run and test your program.</li>

<li>
Assuming a 12 Mhz clock, what is the worse case propagation delay from
an input transition to an output transition? (Calculate this value and
verify by measuring it with dScope. Write a brief paragraph describing
your procedure.)</li>

<li>
What is the size of your code in bytes (including any data)? What is the
size of the executable program (in bytes including any data)? Explain any
differences.</li>
</ol>
