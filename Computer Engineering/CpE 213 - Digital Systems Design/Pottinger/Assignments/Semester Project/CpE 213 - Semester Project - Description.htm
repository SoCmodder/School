<h1>
CpE 213 Digital System Design</h1>

<h1>
Semester Project</h1>

<h3>
Summary</h3>
The semester project is to design a simple toy or game using a microcontroller
like the 8051.&nbsp; The device is to be constrained in the sense that
the hardware is limited to a microcontroller, four switches, four LEDs,
a piezo electric speaker, and a battery power supply with on/off switch.&nbsp;
You will be expected to supply a complete design of both hardware and software,
promotional material, economic analysis, and construction details.&nbsp;
Your design is to be verified via simulation and documented in the form
of a formal report.&nbsp; A total of 200 points toward your final grade
will be awarded on the basis of homework.&nbsp; This capstone project will
be a part of that homework grade.&nbsp; The project score will be calculated
on the basis of the percentage points given in the due dates list below.&nbsp;
This is an individual project, not a team effort.
<h3>
Project description</h3>
The project is to consist of a simple toy or game that can be played on
a device constructed with a microcontroller, battery power supply, on/off
switch, four push button switches, four LED's (red, yellow, green, orange
colors),&nbsp; a piezo-electric speaker, a crystal, printed circuit board,
enclosure, and miscellaneous passive components (resistors and capacitors)
as required.&nbsp; Your device need not use all these components but will
limited to these.&nbsp; Nothing more may be added.
<br>Within these hardware constraints, you are free to be as creative as
you can.&nbsp; You are not required to use an 8051 microcontroller.&nbsp;
It can be any microcontroller except the Phillips 89C51Rx2 series (89C51RD2
etc).&nbsp; Since you don't actually need to build it, you may use any
style package including chip-scale packaging.&nbsp; You should make use
of low power design techniques since the device will be battery powered.&nbsp;
See http://www.ece.umr.edu/~hjp/ieee/html for an example of a previous
design that implements the game of 'Simon' on this class of hardware.
<br>Credit will be given for creativity, design and documentation quality,
attention to detail, completeness of your testing procedure (likelihood
that your design will actually work the first time), low cost, low power,
size, weight, software portability, and other such 'engineering issues'.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Requirements</h3>
A one-page specification of the device is due April 4, 2001.&nbsp; The
specification should be marketing oriented and not reveal any 'trade secrets'
or technical details such as schematics or software flow charts that might
result in undue advantage to your competition.&nbsp; A late or missing
specification will result in a maximum grade of 'B' for the project.
<br>A hardware design is required.&nbsp; While you don't actually need
to build it, your documentation should be complete enough to enable someone
else to do so.&nbsp; As a minimum, this means that all parts are to be
identified completely, including vendor, vendor part number, manufacturer,
and manufacturer's part number.&nbsp; A complete schematic is to be supplied.&nbsp;
An assembly drawing (board layout showing the position of the parts) is
to be supplied.&nbsp; Machine drawings are prefered but hand sketches will
be accepted.&nbsp; Your formal report should include a section on design
rationale.&nbsp; This section will include an analysis of why certain parts
were selected, values chosen, etc.&nbsp; Your report should also include
a manufacturing cost analysis.&nbsp; As a minimum this should include the
cost of all components including the circuit board.&nbsp; Actual costs
are prefered but reasonable estimates will be accepted as long as they
are identified as such and the basis for the estimate given (wild guess,
educated guess, vendor estimate, etc).&nbsp; Your analysis should include
an estimate of the total cost to produce a run of 100,000 devices.&nbsp;
Your analysis should also include a calculated estimate of battery life
under normal operating conditions.&nbsp; Be sure to describe any assumptions
you make about 'normal operating conditions' and keep in mind that the
most likely user of your device is a 10 year old and not another engineer!
<br>A verified software implementation is required.&nbsp; This is likely
to be the most challenging aspect of the project.&nbsp; As a minimum you
must simulate your code with the Keil development system, but you are free
to use whatever resources you can bring to the project.&nbsp; Your program
can be written in whatever language you choose but you must be able to
execute it on your chosen hardware.&nbsp; In other words, don't expect
to run a 100,000 line C++ program on a 2k byte PIC processor!&nbsp; Your
draft report must include some sort of high level description of your program
(flow chart, state diagram, psuedo-code, etc) and a source code listing
showing correct compilation (or assembly if appropriate).&nbsp; Some evidence
that an executable file (hex or otherwise) suitable for the target microcontroller
was produced must be supplied.&nbsp; This evidence must include a count
of the number of bytes of memory required (data and code).&nbsp; The target
processor must be able to support your program's requirements.&nbsp; In
other words, don't expect a Phillip's 87C752 to run a 4k byte program that
uses 250 bytes of data.
<br>The draft report should be as close to the final report as possible.&nbsp;
Software bugs and missing data are acceptable at the time of the draft
report but a missing or late draft report will result in a maximum project
grade of 'C'.
<br>Your report should give credit for any portion of the design (hardware
or software) not of your own origin.
<br>You are expected to work individually.&nbsp; The only exception to
this rule will be if each member of a team implements a separate game that
can be played on a single composite device.&nbsp; Each member of the team
must make a clearly identifiable and measurable contribution to the project.&nbsp;
Failure to identify each member's contribution will result in a single
project score divided by the number of team members awarded to each member.
<h3>
Suggestions</h3>
A hardcopy report is required but may be supplemented by web pages, and
you are encouraged to do so.&nbsp; Keep your software modular, and keep
platform dependencies isolated to as small a region as possible.&nbsp;
Field programmable parts are nice for development but may be more expensive
for production.&nbsp; Chip packaging can have an indirect effect on cost.&nbsp;
Through-hole technology (DIP packages) generally results in larger, more
expensive, and harder to assemble designs than surface mount technology.&nbsp;
Try implementing your design in Visual C++ or other RAD (rapid application
development) environment on a PC for ease of debugging and then 'port'
it to the microcontroller after your bugs are worked out.&nbsp; You may
have some 'tweaking' to do but the payback is a more productive development
environment.&nbsp; You could even use your sound card to simulate the speaker
but keep in mind that the speaker interface is a simple one similar to
that shown in Chapter 10 of the text.&nbsp; Also keep in mind your target
hardware and the requirement that all of your code will need to work there.
