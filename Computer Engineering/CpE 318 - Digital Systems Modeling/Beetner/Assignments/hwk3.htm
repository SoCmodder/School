<ol>
<li> For the following type:
<p><b>type</b> opcodes <b> is </b> (nop,add,subtract,load,store,jump,jumpsub,branch,halt);</p>
determine: opcodes'left, opcodes'right, opcodes'low, opcodes'ascending, 
opcodes'pos(store), opcodes'val(6), opcodes'succ(jumpsub), 
opcodes'leftof(halt).
Specify the type of each result (i.e. opcodes, boolean, string, etc). </li>
<li> The example on page 48 of the text shows how you might use attributes
to calculate one type results from two other type results.  Show how
the answer (i.e. A:=area'val...) would have to be changed if type 
length and type area were defined to have a <b>range</b> integer'high
<b>downto</b> integer'low.
Feel free to simulate your answer to double check 
if it will work. </li>
<li> Chapter 3, problem 12. </li>
<li> Chapter 3, problem 13. </li>
<li> For problem 13, add assertion or report statements that
	<ol>
	<li> Check and report that the input has a value from 0 
		to 15. Give this assertion a low-severity. </li>
	<li> Check and report that the output has a value from 0 
		to 15. Give this assertion a high-severity. </li>
	<li> Reports the value of the output. </li>
	</ol>
As always with problems that build on one another in this class, 
if you were not able to get problem 4 (13 in book), you may
indicate how you would create these assertion/report
statements and how you might add them to 4 for full credit.

</ol>
Problems 3, 4, and 5 must be handed in as a typed computer printout.  
I highly recommend you simulate them before turning them in.
