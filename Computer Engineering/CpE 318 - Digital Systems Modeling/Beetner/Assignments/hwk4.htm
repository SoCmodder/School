<ol>
<li> Create a record type which includes elements of type
distance, dayofweek, integer, bit, and an eight-bit vector.

<li> Ch 4, problem 11.  Note the use of the word
"general" (read: and size inputs/outputs).
After writing the model, instantiate
it in an entity with 4-bit inputs and write a testbench
that tests the 4-bit entity over some suitable set of
input values (should be sufficient to show that it
should work under most conditions).  Turn in a) code 
for the original model, b)
code for the instantiated entity and testbench, and
c) a printout of the simulation waveform resulting
from b) which shows your model works.

<li> The 8051 microcontroller has a command "SWAP A", which 
swaps the low and high nibble within the 8-bit accumulator.
Write a short section of code (entity/architecture/process)
to perform this instruction.  You only have to a) declare
the accumulator as an array, and b) write code to perform the
command.  Feel free to use simulation to check your answer.

<li> For the following short VHDL program:

<PRE>
entity blah is
end entity blah

architecture blab of blah is
	signal x,y:bit;
begin
	p1: process is
	begin
		x<= '0', '1' after 5 ns, '1' after 10 ns, '0' after 12 ns,
			'1' after 15 ns, '0' after 25 ns;
		wait;
	end process p1;
	p2: process is
	begin
		y <=x;
		wait on x;
		y <= x'delayed(2 ns);
		wait on x'transaction;
		y <= x;
		wait on x until x = '1' for 5 ns;
		y <= x'last_value;
	end process p2;
end architecture blab.
</PRE>

Draw a "waveform" (a plot) of x'delayed(5 ns), x'stable(3 ns), x'quiet(3 ns), 
and the other 6 signal attributes listed on page 112 for the signal x.
Also draw the signal y.
For the boolean values, show them as a '1' when they are true and
as a '0' when they are false.  I would like the waveforms to be
accurate for each whole ns.  For example, I should be able to
look at your plot at timestep 7 ns and tell what each of the
attributes should be.  I might not now the correct value at
7.5 ns.  Your plot can end at 30 to 35 ns.
I prefer you work these values
out by hand rather than through simulation, as you will be working
them out by hand on a test.
