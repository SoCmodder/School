<ol>
<li> Problem 6.6 from the book.  You do not have to turn in
a behavioral model -- only a register transfer level model -- however,
you might find it useful to design the behavioral model first.
A testbench is required.

<p>Turn in simulation results which prove your model works <u> and</u>
email me code for your model and testbench.  To email me your code
in a reasonable format:
	<ol>
	<li> Create a directory called something like hwk7 </li>
	<li> Create all .vhd files in this directory.  Compile
	and simulate the files in this directory too. MAKE SURE YOUR NAME
	(IDENTIFIER) IS GIVEN IN THE .VHD FILE. </li>
	<li> When you're finished with your code, tar and zip the files
	into a single compressed file.  For example, if your files are
	in the directory hwk7 and your identifier is "superman", you
	should tar and zip your files with the Unix command: 
	<pre> tar -cf - hwk7 | gzip -9 > superman.tar.gz </pre>
	This command must be run from the directory that contains
	the hwk7 directory. (If you cannot locate gzip from your machine,
	you may need to replace "gzip" above with "/usr/local/gnu/bin/gzip").
	</li>
	<li> Email me the hwk7.tar.gz file (don't send any other files)
		as an attachment using MICROSOFT OUTLOOK (using an attachment
		under pine or some such causes problems for the TAs). </li>
	</ol>

<p>WARNING: This problem may take a while to finish.
