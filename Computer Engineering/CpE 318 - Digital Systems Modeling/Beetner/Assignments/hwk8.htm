<ol>
<li> Problem 7.13 from the book. </li>
<li> Write a function overloading the "*" operator to perform
multiplication on fixed-point binary numbers.
Your function should use the data formats and algorithms found
in the multiplier entities in Chapter 6 (Hint: all the code
in the book can be found at the author's web site,
http://www.ashenden.com.au/designers-guide/DG.html).
</li>
<li> Problem 8.8 from the book.  Include the "*" operator you created above.
</li>
<li> Create an entity/architecture pair which multiplies two
16-bit fixed-point binary numbers and returns a 32-bit result.
This multiplier will be different than the one in Chapter 6 in
that it will use the package and associated types/functions you created in the
last couple of problems.  Show your code works by creating a
testbench and simulating the multiplication of 4 or 5 numbers.
The testbench should start and finish with numbers of type real
(i.e. inputs are 0.20 and 0.314 of type real, which are converted to binary.
The output from the multiplier is binary, but is converted to type real
for testing).

<p>NOTE: Creation of this testbench will be worth a disproportionate number
of points, as it will show that your code for the last 3 problems
is accurate.  If you are unable finish all the problems, create
a testbench to test as much as you can (your * function, your package,
the to_fp and to_vector procedures, etc).
</li>
