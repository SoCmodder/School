<li> Essay and short-answer questions require a complete answer for complete credit.  If in doubt, elaborate.  A simple "yes" or "no" will rarely get full credit. 
</li>

<li> A question where you include a completely correct answer and some wrong information will not be given full credit.  For example, if I ask you to bake a delicious cake and you bake me a delicious cake, you will receive full credit.  If you bake me a cake which is edible but not delicious, you will receive partial credit.  If you bake me a delicious cake but then put some terrible tasting frosting on it which I didn't ask for, you will only receive partial credit -- the cake is no longer delicious because of the frosting. </li>

<li> Good English on essay or short-answer type questions is required - If I can't understand what it is you're trying to say then I can't give you full credit. </li>

<li> Feel free to elaborate on any question where you are confused or think your answer requires some explanation.  I will take into account what you've said when I grade your test.  This includes true/false and multiple choice questions. </li>

<li> In general, I will take off points for wrong answers on multiple
choice questions.  If you would like to try for partial credit, try
writing an explanation beside the question rather than guessing. </li>

<li> Show your work when possible.  Sometimes I am looking for more
than just the final answer -- I am looking for the method you used
to get it.  In those cases, the answer with no work would not receive
full credit. </li>

<li> If you are running short on time, do your best to outline how you would solve the problem (for partial credit). </li>

<li> If you cannot do all of a problem, do what you can.  I will give you
partial credit. </li>

<li> If you are unsure of what I want or am asking, please ask me for advice. </li>
