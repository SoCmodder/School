Tentatively due: Tue., Sept. 10.

<LI> For each of the following ASICs, briefly describe the technology, the designer's tasks, a ballpark figure for the number of gates per chip, and the time required for development of an appropriate project: 
<UL>
<LI>Programmable logic devices 
<LI>Gate arrays (MGA)
<LI>Standard cells (CBICS) 
<LI>full custom chips 
<LI>Field programmable gate arrays (eg. Actel, Xilinx)
</UL>

<LI>
FPGA's have traditionally been more expensive in large volume than MGA or CBIC's.  This gap has gradually been closing.  Given the assumptions of Section 1.4.4 on the price per gate of different ASIC technologies, what has to change for the price per gate for an FPGA to be less than that for an MGA or CBIC - if all three use the same fabrication process?

<LI>
Perform the Mentor Graphics Tutorial at 
<A href = "http://www.ece.umr.edu/tutorials/digital1/digital1.html">  
http://www.ece.umr.edu/tutorials/digital1/digital1.html</A>.  
Write down each step you performed and a brief description of what it did
(e.g. 1. entered "sul" and "swd" at the command prompt -- set the working directory and library. 2. typed "da" -- started design architect).  
If a step was repeated, you do not have to list it a second time.
You will find this list useful in future labs.
<p>
You may mostly skip over the sections on Bold Browser and on 
Design Manager, as these tools are not used so much anymore.
Also: the logging in procedure has been simplified since this tutorial
was written.  The only thing you really have to do now before starting Mentor
Graphics is to a) create a directory you will use for this assignment,
b) cd to that directory, then c) type 'sul' (return) and 'swd' (return).
These last two Unix commands will set the Mentor Graphics environment
variables for the working directory and user library.

<p>
We will take some time out of class to start this part of the assignment.
