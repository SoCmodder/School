<li> Using the following procedure, construct a VHDL model of a 
two input NAND gate with an entity equal to the following:</FONT></P>
<UL><PRE><FONT size=-1>ENTITY nand2 IS
 PORT (a,b: IN BIT; c: OUT BIT);
END ENTITY nand2;</FONT></PRE></UL>

This assignment should typically be run from your ece Unix account.
If a Unix machine isn't available, you can run Modelsim remotely
from an NT machine using X-WIN32.  You can start X-WIN32 from
the START>Computer Center Applications>Network Access>X-Win32.  Once
started, you can open a session to one of the ECE unix machines by
pressing the X-Win32 button on your menu bar and selecting the
appropriate machine from the Sessions menu.  If the machine you
want is not there, you can create a new session using X-Util
(also from the X-Win32 button) and "edit session>new session".
The easiest way to use the tool is to do the following: 
under the new session 
window, give your session a name and select XDMCP and Broadcast.
Now press the X-Win32 button and select your session from the
list.  The X-Win32 tool will go out and find all local machines
which can handle XDMCP.  Select one and hit OK.  Your PC
will now act as though you were logged directly into the selected
Unix machine.  Selecting the rsh option when creating a new
session can also be good, as you can access more machines, but
is a bit more complicated.
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Read the users guide for Modelsim.  The file
	/usr/local/modeltech/docs/ee_doc_index.pdf is a good place
	to start.  Use acroread on the Unix machines to read it
	(i.e. acroread ee_doc_index.pdf). </FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Create a new subdirectory in your Unix account
	called <I>twoinand.</I></FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Use your favorite text editor to <B>create a source file</B> 
  called <I>my_nand.vhd</I> and enter the entity shown above.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Create a work directory with the command: vlib work. You 
  only need to do this once. This creates a subdirectory in <I>twoinnand</I> 
  which will persist until you delete it. <I>Work</I> is where the VHDL analyzer 
  creates all of its output files.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Compile the source file with the command: vcom -93 my_nand.vhd. 
  This compiles using VHDL'93 syntax. Leave off the 93 for VHDL'87 syntax. Enter 
  <I>vcom -help</I> for a list of options.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Examine the work directory with the command v<I>dir</I>. You 
  should see the name of the entity you just analyzed.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Use your text editor to <B>add a suitable architecture</B> 
  to your nand model. Call it A1 and use a simple signal assignment statement 
  for the model.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Compile the source file again. Fix any errors.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Enter the command <I>vdir nand2</I> and <B>describe the 
  result.</B></FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Bring up the simulator with the command <I>vsim nand2 a1. 
  </I>This will invoke the simulator on the entity <I>nand2</I> and the 
  architecture <I>a1</I> and start a command window. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=-1>In the command window, type the command <I>view *</I> and 
  <B>describe each of the windows</B> displayed.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>In the command window, type the command <I>add wave *</I> and 
  <B>describe the signals</B> which are displayed.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Type the command <I>force a 0</I> to force signal a to a 
  zero. Type a similar command for input b.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Run the simulator for 100 nS by typing the command <I>run 
  100.</I></FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Force a to a 1 and run for another 100 nS.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Force b to a 1 and run for 100 nS.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1> Try clicking around in some of the windows or selecting
	signals and hitting the right mouse button. Play around a bit.
	<B>Describe some interesting things you found that you 
	can do with the simulator</B>.
  <LI><FONT size=-1>Finish the grey code input sequence ab=00,10,11,01,00. 
	You can force multiple values using the command 
	<I>force a 0 0, 1 10, 0 20</I> where value/time pairs are separated
	by commas.  Your 
  simulation should last for 500 nSec.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT size=-1><B>Make a plot</B> of the wave window and exit the 
  simulator (you can make a plot by using the FILE>Write to Postscript option
in the wave window).</FONT> </LI></OL>
<LI> Implement the following digital filter in VHDL
	<P>
	y0 = c(0)*x(0) + c(1)*x(1) + c(2)*x(2)
	<P> where c(0) = -4, c(1) = +5, and c(2) = -3.  Have 
	the output y0 update on each rising edge of the clock. 
	Make c(0)-c(2) constants so they could easily be changed if needed.
	Give your filter a "clear" input that will clear any registers.
	You do not have to simulate your results, though I would run it
	through vcom if I were you to make sure it is syntactically correct.
	(e.g. vcom -93 <.vhd file name>.  See above) 
	-- of course if you simulate
	you'll KNOW for certain if it is right.

	<P>
	Try to predict the synthesized result by drawing a block 
	diagram consisting of macro blocks like registers, adders, multipliers,
	and the like.   Turn your predicted result in.
<LI> Write an entity/architecture pair description of a general-purpose 
D-flip-flop with the following I/O:
	<UL>
	<LI> Inputs: D, CLK, CLR, and PRS (all single bits)
	<LI> Outputs: Q, Q_not 
	</UL>
CLR (clear) and PRS (preset) are asynchronous.  
At a minimum, compile your design using VCOM to be sure it is syntactically
correct.
