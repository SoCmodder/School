Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:baste:24 - All of the external outputs in this design are using
   slew-rate-limited output drivers.  The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the original
   design.  Please see your vendor interface documentation for specific
   information on how to do this within your design-entry tool.
   Note: You should be careful not to designate too many outputs which switch
   together as fast, because this can cause excessive ground bounce.  For more
   information on this subject, please refer to the IOB switching characteristic
   guidelines for the device you are using in the Programmable Logic Data Book.
